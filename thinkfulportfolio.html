           Hi there, my name is Donna Phan. I am currently located in Sacramento, California. 
           I am a person who loves everything that is creative. I am always curious about
           human psychology and I love learning about self-expression through art and psychology. I believe that 
           coding is a great combination of problem-solving and creative thinking. 
           <p>As a perfectionist Psychology graduate, I'm interested in: <ul>
           <li>Web design that speaks to the user</li>
           <li>Efficiency in coding format</li>
           <li>Solving and debugging code</li>
            </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As a beginner in coding, I am still learning on a daily basis. Sometimes 
          it can get overwhelming with the amount of languages and concepts
          to learn. However, it didn't take long to find out that coding is so much fun!
          Solving problems and having a sense of achievement can get quite addicting. 

         

        <p>
          Outside of coding and school, I like to de-stress by walking and playing with my dog, Tofu (yes, he is the handsome dog in the picture). 
          My love for animals started young. I grew up in Arizona and was surrounded by horses throughout my childhood. I fell in love with
          horseback riding and so did my grade-school friends. My horse-crazy classmates and I started playing a browser-based multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) 
          called Horseisle. I am both embarrassed and proud to admit that my squad were the weird horse-obsessed kids in elementary school. Besides the point, Horseisle was the
          first game that introduced coding to kids. It is crazy that the game had us code our profiles in HTML without even knowing it! I guess I can say I started coding when I was 
          10 years old. Now, everytime I code in HTML, I get a wonderful nostalgic feeling.
